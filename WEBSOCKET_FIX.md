# WebSocket Connection Fix

This document describes the fixes implemented to resolve WebSocket connection issues in the Feynman application.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. WebSocket Connection Failure
**Problem**: When OpenAI API connection failed, the entire WebSocket connection would close, preventing browser communication.

**Solution**: Implemented graceful error handling that keeps the browser WebSocket open even when OpenAI connection fails.

### 2. Unreachable Pattern Warning
**Problem**: Rust compiler warning about unreachable pattern in WebSocket message handling.

**Solution**: Restructured pattern matching to handle all cases properly.

### 3. Poor Error Messages
**Problem**: Generic error messages that didn't help with debugging connection issues.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive logging and informative error messages.

## New Features

### TEST_MODE Environment Variable
Set `TEST_MODE=true` to run the application without connecting to OpenAI. This is useful for:
- Local development
- Testing WebSocket functionality
- Demonstrating the application when OpenAI is unavailable

### Retry Functionality
When OpenAI connection fails, you can send a "retry_openai" message through the WebSocket to attempt reconnection.

### Enhanced Error Handling
- API key validation
- Better connection status reporting
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## Usage

### Normal Mode
```bash
cd backend
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here cargo run
```

### Test Mode
```bash
cd backend
TEST_MODE=true cargo run
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd front
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required for normal mode)
- `TEST_MODE`: Set to "true" to enable test mode without OpenAI

## Technical Details

The fixes maintain backward compatibility while improving resilience:

1. **Connection Stability**: Browser WebSocket stays open even when OpenAI fails
2. **Error Recovery**: Retry mechanisms for failed connections
3. **Development Support**: Test mode for development without external dependencies
4. **Better Debugging**: Enhanced logging and error reporting

## Testing

The application has been tested with:
- OpenAI connection failures
- Network connectivity issues
- Frontend audio streaming
- WebSocket reconnection scenarios
- Test mode functionality
